### Alberta/CBE Alignment:

To make these more CBE-specific, you could:
- Change "grade-level expectations" to "curricular outcomes"
- Add "demonstrating progress toward curricular competencies"
- Include "applying knowledge and understanding from the Program of Studies"
- Reference "inquiry-based learning" where appropriate
- Note "developing skills aligned with [specific curriculum outcome codes]"

**Example CBE-Aligned Version:**
"Riley demonstrates solid understanding of ELA curricular outcomes for Grade 3 and engages thoughtfully with fiction texts. They are working toward greater proficiency with writing conventions outlined in the Program of Studies, particularly punctuation. Riley will continue to develop these curricular competencies through focused editing practice and peer collaboration."
